## 💡 Tips

- **Use version notes** to track what changed in each version
- **Tag consistently** for easier searching (e.g., always use "metal" not "metals")
- **Export regularly** to backup your library
- **Share libraries** with your team via ZIP export/import
- **Keep the latest version** clean and well-tested

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

**"No node group selected"**
- Make sure you've clicked on a node group node, not just any node

**Node group doesn't appear after clicking**
- Check your cursor is inside the editor area
- Make sure you're in the correct editor type (Shader/Compositor/Geometry)

**Can't find saved node groups**
- Check the sort/search isn't filtering them out
- Refresh the library with the refresh button
- Verify the correct editor type (shader groups only show in shader editor)
